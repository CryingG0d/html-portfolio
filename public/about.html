<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Kerim Halilovic, a Bosnian citizen who is currently 26 years old. Lived 22 years in Bosnia and the rest abroad (Austria).
  I have finished a Computer Design - mechanical technician (High school)degree and also enrolled into a University where I studied
  Informatics. I took a break from University and in the mean time started working with my dad(digital part) and started learning to 
  code again. I'm also working for 6 months in a firm as Samsung Support agent, where I also learned some new tools. Before I worked 
  at my dads firm as well, mostly labor work and during my student times as catering waiter.
</p>

<p>I started this course with my friend, and I'm thinking to go more into it as it'll definitely help me on my path of finishing
  my university, finding a better job and as well help out with my dads business in terms of investing, building a site and combining
  it with his connections and other arts of work. This is just a start, I'm eager to learn and to develop.

<p>See you soon.</p>
